# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

In this challenge, I created a portolio page from scratch to use as we progress through the quarter. I plan to fill it up with projects and to finalize the layout/styling at a later date.

To create this project, I used flexbox, media queries, CSS variables, and many other basic CSS tools that I have learned so far. My layout was required to be responsive to smaller screen sizes, needed to have working local links, and needed to link to my other projects.
